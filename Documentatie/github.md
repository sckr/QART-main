# Github notities

In this document I record what I learn from the codeacademy course on Github.

## Projectmanagement

+ **Issues:** a tracking tool to help track al changes that we want to make to de the code.

+ **Projects:** A project management tool build in to github
  
  + A project can be connected to one or more repositories, but can also stand alone.

## Github CLI (Command Line Interface)

*Moet ik op een ander moment uitproberen*

## Automated testing

On Github you can use Github Actions:

> "[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a powerful, advanced GitHub feature that enables users to define 
> custom and automated workflows triggered on various types of events ..."

1. .github folder holds the test files??

2. Inside .github is **workflows**. Github looks inside this directory for defenitions of GitHub Actions

3. .yaml files in the **workflows** folder

### Action Syntax

- **name:** the name of the action

- **on:** when the action should be executed

- **jobs:** speaks for itself?

## Things to look into

- **rulesets** - protecting the branch from force pushing
